# 🧸💥 MILA WICK: TODDLER'S REVENGE 💥🧸
*A Quirky Top-Down Wave Shooter*

## 🚀 Setup and Installation

This guide will help you set up and run "Mila Wick: Toddler's Revenge" on your local machine.

**Prerequisites:**
*   **Python:** Version 3.12 or higher. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
*   **pipenv:** This project uses `pipenv` to manage dependencies. If you don't have it, install it by running:
    ```bash
    pip install pipenv
    ```
    (You might need to use `pip3` depending on your Python installation).

**Installation Steps:**

1.  **Get the Code:**
    *   If you've cloned this repository, navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
    *   If you have the files locally, ensure you are in the root directory of the project (the one containing `Pipfile` and `main.py`).

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Open your terminal in the project's root directory and run:
    ```bash
    pipenv install
    ```
    This command will create a virtual environment and install all the necessary packages listed in the `Pipfile` (like Pygame, SQLAlchemy, etc.).

3.  **Run the Game:**
    After the dependencies are installed, you can run the game using:
    ```bash
    pipenv run python main.py
    ```

**Platform-Specific Notes:**

*   **Windows:**
    *   Ensure Python is added to your PATH during installation.
    *   The commands above should work in PowerShell or Command Prompt.
*   **Linux:**
    *   You might need to install Python development headers and other system libraries for Pygame to build correctly. For example, on Debian/Ubuntu:
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install python3-dev libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libportmidi-dev
        ```
    *   The commands `pipenv install` and `pipenv run python main.py` should work in your terminal.
*   **macOS:**
    *   It's often recommended to install Python via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
        ```bash
        brew install python@3.12
        brew install pipenv
        ```
    *   Pygame might require SDL libraries, which Homebrew can also help install:
        ```bash
        brew install sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_mixer sdl2_ttf portmidi
        ```
    *   Then, run `pipenv install` and `pipenv run python main.py`.

Now you should be ready to witness Mila's epic rampage!

## 🎮 GAME CONCEPT
Create an absurdly over-the-top action game where a vengeful toddler goes on an epic rampage after her beloved toys get... *desecrated* by the family dog.

---

## 📖 THE ORIGIN STORY
*"Hell hath no fury like a toddler's toy scorned..."*

Little Mila was having the perfect tea party with Mr. Bunny and Princess Sparkles when **DISASTER STRUCK**. Draco, the family's mischievous Golden Retriever, decided her precious toys needed a little... *yellow seasoning*. 

Now armed with determination (and surprisingly advanced weaponry for a 3-year-old), Mila embarks on the most disproportionate revenge quest in gaming history. Because nobody—and we mean NOBODY—pees on Mr. Bunny and lives to bark about it.
